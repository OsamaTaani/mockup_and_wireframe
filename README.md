# EventTip

## Project Description

**EventTip** is an event discovery platform aimed at helping users find the best events in their area. Whether you're looking for concerts, sports games, cultural festivals, or business conferences, EventTip has you covered. Our user-friendly interface makes it easy to explore and book tickets for a wide range of events.

## Tools Used

The entire design and prototyping of **EventTip** were created using **Figma**, a collaborative design and prototyping tool. Figma allowed us to create a seamless user experience, design beautiful interfaces, and showcase the potential of our event discovery platform.

Please note that this project is focused on the design aspect, and the development and functionality of the platform would require additional tools and resources.
